# BioGraphs
A Java library to process biological sequence data using [N-Gram Graphs](http://www.nist.gov/tac/publications/2009/participant.papers/DemokritosGR.proceedings.pdf) and the [JInsect](https://github.com/VHarisop/JInsect/releases/tag/v1.1rc) library.

Contains classes that represent biological sequences using n-gram graphs as well as
utilities for creating efficient graph databases. For now, indexing using DFS 
coding as well as a custom similarity metric is supported.
