# What is it?
BioGraphs is a Java library that uses n-gram graphs to index, analyze and classify biological sequence data. It is efficient and simple to use:

{% highlight java %}
BioGraph bGraph = new BioGraph("ACTAGTACTA");
System.out.println(bGraph.toDot());
{% endhighlight %}

## Uses
For now, BioGraphs contains utilities for indexing biological sequences using their n-gram graph representation. A custom graph similarity metric is employed to build an efficient tree-based index.  

In the near future, BioGraphs will be expanded with facilities for classification and data analysis.
